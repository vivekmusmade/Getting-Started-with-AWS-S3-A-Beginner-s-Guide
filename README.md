# Getting-Started-with-AWS-S3-A-Beginner-s-Guide


Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is one of the most popular AWS services, providing scalable storage for various use cases. In this guide, Iâ€™ll walk through the basics of creating an S3 bucket, uploading files, and setting permissions.

**Step 1: Creating an S3 Bucket**

Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to Services > S3.
Click Create bucket and provide a unique name (e.g., my-first-s3-bucket).

**Step 2: Uploading a File**

Open your bucket and click Upload.
Select a file from your local system and click Upload.

**Step 3: Setting Bucket Permissions**

In the bucket settings, navigate to the Permissions tab.
Configure access policies using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
Use Case:
Recently, I used S3 to store logs for a web application. By enabling versioning, I ensured that historical log files were not overwritten, providing a backup for troubleshooting.
